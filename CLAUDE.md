# Claude Code instructions

Treat the directory containing this file as the project root. Return to it before project commands; do not derive project paths from the shell's inherited working directory. Start with [README.md](README.md) and follow only the compact documentation needed.

For every non-trivial task, follow [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md). Act as lead orchestrator. Before planning, ask Codex to validate your interpretation with `tools/ask_codex.sh`. Then have Codex challenge the plan. Proceed automatically when agreement is reached. Assign exactly one implementer and require independent review by the other agent. Ask the user only for unresolved material ambiguity or disagreement, consequential preference, or required approval for destructive/high-risk action.

Run Python through `tools/project_python.sh`, which resolves `/mnt/sda2/python/.venv/bin/python` independently of the caller's working directory. Do not use legacy `stl_batch_fix.py` as repair-design authority while the refactor is unfinished.

Before each new collaboration task, run `tools/reset_codex.sh`. Do not reset
between phases or fix reviews. Interpretation and planning reuse one Codex
session; the first review starts separately and later reviews resume it. Pass
complete task context to the first call of each role, then concise updates on
follow-ups. Implementation through `tools/run_codex.sh` has its own session and
requires your independent review. Never run collaboration calls concurrently.

When the user requests both AIs clean, save a handoff if needed, reset the Codex
pointers after active calls finish, and tell the user to run `/clear` in Claude.
Clearing Claude alone does not reset Codex. Follow the full procedure in
`COLLABORATION.md`; do not claim either reset clears files or configured memory.
