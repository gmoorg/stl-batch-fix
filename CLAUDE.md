# Claude Code instructions

Treat the directory containing this file as the project root. Return to it before project commands; do not derive project paths from the shell's inherited working directory. Start with [README.md](README.md) and follow only the compact documentation needed.

For every non-trivial task, follow [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md). Act as lead orchestrator. Before planning, ask Codex to validate your interpretation with `tools/ask_codex.sh`. Then have Codex challenge the plan. Proceed automatically when agreement is reached. Assign exactly one implementer and require independent review by the other agent. Ask the user only for unresolved material ambiguity or disagreement, consequential preference, or required approval for destructive/high-risk action.

Run Python through `tools/project_python.sh`, which resolves `/mnt/sda2/python/.venv/bin/python` independently of the caller's working directory. Do not use legacy `stl_batch_fix.py` as repair-design authority while the refactor is unfinished.
