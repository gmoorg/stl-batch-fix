## Evidence that has not been gathered

Stated so it is not mistaken for settled:

- The sketch's `admit` blocking path **never fired in the demo run** — the
  trace shows the happy case only. Admission control is written, not exercised.
- The watchdog and the pool restart have **never fired in any real run**, so
  removing them is reasoning, not measurement.
- Nothing has been measured about thread-vs-process memory behaviour under the
  real workload. The claim that threads are fine rests on every worker being
  blocked in `communicate()`, which is true of the current design but has not
  been profiled.
